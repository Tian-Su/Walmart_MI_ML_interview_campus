# Walmart_MI_ML_interview_campus

We will leverage this new kaggle dataset for a simple exercise.
https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset

Tasks:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Come up with an interesting question based on your EDA.
3. Build 1 supervised or unsupervise ML model to address your question. You can build more than 1 model, but be careful of time management.
4. Write a short report. 
    Starting with your interesting question based on your EDA. Draw some conclusion from your model, and propose next step to further investigate. 
    You can use word, ppt or similar format. 
    If you are using Jupyter notebook, you can have this report at the beginning our your notebook as session 1. Code create visualization can be in this first session. All other code should be in the second session below the report.  

What to turn in:
1. Create a branch with this format: date_firstname_lastname. In my case, it will be 20200229_tian_su. Please use all lower case.
2. Create a folder in your branch with this format: firstname_lastname. In my case, it will be tian_su. Please use all lower case.
3. Put your report and code in the aforementioned folder. Please don't include the data set. Commit. Push to the Github as a branch (date_firstname_lastname). See example https://github.com/Tian-Su/Walmart_MI_ML_interview_campus/tree/20200229_tian_su.
4. Create a pull request to master branch. See example https://github.com/Tian-Su/Walmart_MI_ML_interview_campus/pull/1. (If you don't know how to create pull request: https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Notes:
1. Feel free to use internet. 
2. You can use your old code. You can also use code found on the internet. Any code > 5 lines borrowed from others should be cited. 
3. You can merge in additional dataset to help your analysis. Any additional dataset should be cited.
